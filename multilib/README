KISS-MULTILIB
-------------
This repository contains all you should need to bootstrap a multilib kiss system, and some packages that need multilib.

This is built for gkiss (glibc) cos that's what I use. Musl steps should be similar, except using binaries from a musl distro to bootstrap with.

REPOSITORIES
------------
./bootstrap_repo: binaries borrowed from Arch Linux, for bootstrapping.
./repo:           packages that are too complicated to autogen (there aren't too many), and multilib-dependent packages and their dependancies.
./generated:      packages autogenerated using ./bin/kiss-build32 (some of the depends files may have been edited so they pull in 32bit makedepends).


BOOTSTRAPPING
-------------
The community repository is required for libmpc
./repo and ./bootstrap_repo are required for the new toolchain

0.) Ensure CONFIG_COMPAT_32 and CONFIG_COMPAT_32BIT_TIME are set in your kernel
1.) Install gcc.archbin (Arch Linux's GCC binary)
2.) Build gcc
3.) Remove gcc.archbin (Remove this first to avoid conflict hell)
4.) Install gcc
5.) Build glibc
6.) Remove lib32-glibc.archbin (Remove this first to avoid conflict hell)
7.) Install glibc
BONUS.) Remove libmpc if you don't want it, it was needed for the GCC binary

./bootstrap_repo is no longer required.
You should now have a multilib system that can rebuild itself!


TODO:
- remove dependancy on isl (gcc bug? or i'm just dumb (the more likely option))

vim: wrap
